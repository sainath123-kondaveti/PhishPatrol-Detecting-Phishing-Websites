![PhishPatrol Logo](#) <!-- Add your logo or project image here -->

## 📌 Project Overview

**PhishPatrol** is a machine learning-based phishing URL detection system designed to identify malicious websites using ensemble models. It leverages lexical, host-based, and content-based URL features to classify phishing attempts with high precision and speed. The core model integrates powerful ML classifiers like XGBoost, AdaBoost, and MLP using a Voting Classifier to ensure robustness and accuracy.

## 🧠 Methodology

The project follows a three-module structure:

1. **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**  
   - Preprocessing two phishing datasets (~21k URLs total)
   - Feature selection: lexical, SSL, domain age, special chars
   - Normalization and encoding

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trained 7 ML classifiers
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Hyperparameter tuning via **Optuna**

3. **Voting Ensemble Classifier**  
   - Combined best-performing models (XGB, MLP, RF)
   - Majority-vote-based classification
   - Streamlit GUI for real-time predictions
